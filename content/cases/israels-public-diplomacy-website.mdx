## Context

Israel’s public diplomacy website serves as a primary touchpoint for journalists, policymakers, diplomats, and the general public seeking information about the country’s positions, policies, and narratives.

Over time, the site had accumulated content from multiple teams and eras. Key messages were difficult to find, important materials were buried under legacy pages, and visual hierarchy did not match the organization’s current communication priorities.

The redesign aimed to sharpen the site’s role: not as an archive of everything ever published, but as a **clear, credible, and accessible entry point** for international audiences.

## Challenge

The core challenge was to build a site that could:

- Communicate **clear, prioritized narratives** without oversimplifying complex topics.
- Strengthen **credibility** through tone, structure, and visual language.
- Support **fast, multi-platform consumption** by people with limited time and high skepticism.

All of this needed to happen in a context where every word and visual choice may be closely scrutinized by supporters, critics, and neutral observers alike.

## Constraints

Several factors shaped the redesign:

- Multiple internal stakeholders, each with their own priorities and content ownership.
- A large body of legacy content—much of it still important, but not all of it suitable as a front-door experience.
- Accessibility and performance requirements for audiences across devices, connection speeds, and accessibility needs.

The project required a content strategy that could **respect institutional complexity** while delivering a focused user experience.

## Strategy

Our strategy centered on reframing the site around **core stories and user journeys** rather than internal organizational structures.

<ProcessStep number="01" title="Message-First Architecture">
We identified the 8–10 core narratives the organization needed to communicate, then structured the information architecture around those messages rather than around departments or historical categories.
</ProcessStep>

<ProcessStep number="02" title="Layered Information Depth">
Each key topic page was designed with a clear progression—from concise, high-level explanation to deeper context, data, and primary source materials—so users can go as deep as they need without being forced into detail.
</ProcessStep>

<ProcessStep number="03" title="Tone, Credibility, and Clarity">
We worked closely with communication teams to develop guidelines for language, visual evidence, and sourcing that balance accuracy, sensitivity, and clarity in a highly scrutinized environment.
</ProcessStep>

## Architecture

The redesigned site is organized into three main experience layers:

**Front-Door Overview**

A concise, visually-driven overview of Israel’s key positions and priority topics, optimized for first-time and time-constrained visitors. This layer emphasizes clarity and orientation.

**Thematic Topic Hubs**

Topic-specific hubs (e.g., regional context, policy areas, historical background) that combine narrative, timelines, data, and multimedia content. Each hub is structured for both exploration and quick reference.

**Deep Reference & Resources**

Searchable libraries of documents, speeches, fact sheets, and media assets for journalists and professionals who need detailed, citable material.

## Outcomes

Following the redesign and launch:

<CaseStats
  stats={[
    { value: "Clearer", label: "Information hierarchy for priority topics" },
    { value: "Improved", label: "Time-on-page for key narratives" },
    { value: "Higher", label: "Mobile and international engagement" },
    { value: "Stronger", label: "Perceived credibility and clarity" },
  ]}
/>

Analytics and qualitative feedback indicated that users were finding core information more quickly, spending more time with structured topic pages, and relying less on ad-hoc external summaries.

## Impact

The Israel’s Public Diplomacy Website project illustrates systemic’s ability to work at the intersection of **sensitive communication, complex content, and international perception**.

By restructuring content around clearly defined narratives, refining information hierarchy, and optimizing for fast, multi-platform consumption, we helped the organization:

- Present a more coherent and credible public-facing story.
- Reduce friction for journalists, policymakers, and international audiences seeking authoritative information.
- Establish a flexible content architecture that can evolve with future events and communication needs.

For systemic, this project highlights how careful UX and content strategy can elevate public-sector communication in a highly visible, highly scrutinized environment.
