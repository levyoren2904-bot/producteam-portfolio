## Context

SPI-NET was designed for an organization running several parallel communication networks—operational, engineering, and testing—each with its own topology, tools, and operating culture.

Historically, every network had its own dedicated consoles and processes. Engineers monitored one set of tools, operations teams another, and cross-network issues were resolved through emails and phone calls rather than a shared system of record.

As the number of networks and services grew, this fragmentation became a real risk: incidents were harder to correlate, ownership was unclear, and monitoring gaps appeared exactly where reliability mattered most.

## Challenge

The project’s main challenge was designing a **unified control experience** for an organization that:

- Operates across multiple networks, each with different criticality levels and lifecycles.
- Needs to support both day-to-day engineering work and 24/7 operational readiness.
- Cannot afford downtimes or blind spots in its communication infrastructure.

We needed an interface that could bring all networks into a single monitoring surface without flattening their differences—or overwhelming operators with noise.

## Constraints

Several practical and organizational constraints shaped the design:

- Existing NMS and monitoring tools could not be replaced; SPI-NET had to orchestrate and aggregate rather than rebuild from scratch.
- Different teams used different mental models—engineers thought in terms of services and components, while operations cared about availability, SLA impact, and incident timelines.
- Networks spanned both development and operational environments, each with different expectations for stability and change velocity.

These constraints meant SPI-NET had to act as a translation layer: preserving the richness of each domain while offering a coherent, shared view.

## Strategy

Our strategy for SPI-NET centered on three pillars:

<ProcessStep number="01" title="Network-Agnostic Information Architecture">
We separated the core information architecture from any specific network implementation. This allowed us to model networks as reusable primitives—topology, health, incidents, maintenance windows—regardless of their underlying technology.
</ProcessStep>

<ProcessStep number="02" title="Role-Aware Workflows">
We mapped the distinct needs of engineering and operations roles and designed entry points for each: engineers land in service-centric diagnostics views, while operations begin with high-level availability dashboards and incident queues.
</ProcessStep>

<ProcessStep number="03" title="Progressive Drill-Down">
Instead of forcing users to choose between \"high level\" and \"deep technical\" views, SPI-NET lets them start from a stable overview and drill down only when necessary, keeping context visible at every step.
</ProcessStep>

## Architecture

SPI-NET’s interface is organized into four primary layers:

**Global Overview**

A cross-network health dashboard showing the status of all monitored environments—production, staging, and engineering networks. This view highlights where attention is needed rather than mirroring every metric.

**Network Workspaces**

Dedicated workspaces for each network, showing topology, key services, and current incidents. Operators can switch between networks without losing their mental model of how each one behaves.

**Incident & Event Timeline**

An integrated timeline that correlates alerts, changes, and incidents across networks. This helps teams understand whether an issue is isolated or part of a broader pattern.

**Deep Diagnostics**

Service- and component-level views that expose logs, metrics, and dependency maps. These are tuned for engineering work but remain accessible from operations views with clear handoff patterns.

## Outcomes

After SPI-NET’s rollout across the organization’s communication networks:

<CaseStats
  stats={[
    { value: "Unified", label: "Control surface across networks" },
    { value: "Better", label: "Correlation of cross-network incidents" },
    { value: "Lower", label: "Cognitive load on on-call engineers" },
    { value: "Improved", label: "Visibility into critical infrastructure" },
  ]}
/>

Teams reported that they could finally discuss issues using the same map of reality, rather than screenshots from different tools. On-call rotations became more predictable, and incident reviews focused on improving the system—not arguing about whose dashboard was \"right\".

## Impact

SPI-NET demonstrates producTeam’s ability to design for complex, multi-network environments where reliability and clarity are non-negotiable.

By unifying fragmented tools into a coherent product experience, we helped the organization:

- Reduce time spent reconciling conflicting monitoring views.
- Improve confidence in the stability and availability of critical communication networks.
- Create a scalable foundation for future observability and automation initiatives.

For producTeam, SPI-NET is a showcase of how product design can turn operational complexity into a manageable, human-centered system.
